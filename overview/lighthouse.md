# Lighthouse

### Introducing Lighthouse

Lighthouse is a network that connects rollups and searchers to capture MEV across Ethereum. Building on [Secure Block Building (SBB)](secure-block-building-sbb.md), it introduces decentralized, competitive auctions to optimize rollup profits and efficiency.

Currently, MEV is fragmented and locked within individual rollups. Lighthouse unifies these systems, creating a shared pool of MEV opportunities for collective revenue. This unified network gives searchers access to a broader market, and as more rollups participate, the system's scale increases—enhancing Ethereum's economic efficiency.

### **Why Lighthouse?**

Lighthouse broadens MEV access for rollups and searchers, delivering these key benefits:

* **Expanded MEV Market**: Enables cross-rollup arbitrage and L1-L2 arbitrage, alongside CEX-DEX arbitrage, atomic arbitrage, and liquidations.
* **Higher Revenue**: Increases MEV opportunities to attract more searchers while auction mechanisms minimize spam, resulting in higher bids and greater rollup profits.
* **Aligned Incentives**: Distributes MEV profits between rollups and searchers through a transparent and competitive system.

### **How It Works**

Lighthouse extends SBB by coordinating MEV auctions across rollups. Here’s the process:

1. **Searchers**: Identify MEV opportunities like arbitrage and liquidations across multiple rollups, then submit transaction bundles to Lighthouse's blockspace for auctions.
2. **Lighthouse Network**: Conducts auctions where the highest bidders win execution rights for their transaction bundles across rollups.
3. **Rollups**: Execute the winning bundles and collect MEV revenue alongside regular transaction fees.

Lighthouse creates a scalable MEV market where searchers access broader opportunities and rollups increase earnings without added complexity. This integration benefits Ethereum by creating a more efficient, interconnected economy—setting the foundation for a sustainable ecosystem.
