# Why Radius?

Ethereum was founded on the vision of providing a neutral, open infrastructure. But as Ethereum has scaled through rollups, new market structures have emerged. We now see fragmentation: value flows split across rollups, opaque transaction orderflow, and siloed markets. The result is inefficiency, misaligned incentives, and limited collaboration between participants.

At the same time, the stakes are rising. Traditional assets and large-scale capital are beginning to migrate onchain, demanding reliable, predictable, and transparent operations. This migration necessitates verifiable, compliant, and auditable infrastructure to meet emerging global regulatory standards and mitigate systemic risk.

Radius exists to meet this moment: building infrastructure that restores transparent, open markets and enables institutional adoption. It prepares Ethereum for the next era of global finance.
