# Overview

Lighthouse is an auction layer designed to bring professional trading participants (e.g., arbitrageurs, searchers, solvers) into the ecosystem of institutional-grade blockchains.&#x20;

Modern crypto markets are defined by high fragmentation, with liquidity scattered across numerous L1s, L2s, and CEXs. This environment creates profitable price discrepancies and arbitrage opportunities. However, capturing these opportunities safely and efficiently is inherently difficult across fractured venues.

Lighthouse replaces this fragmented environment with a single auction. venue. By acting as a central point of coordination, Lighthouse provides a transparent, competitive venue that translates directly into financial returns and enhanced market efficiency on institutional chains.
