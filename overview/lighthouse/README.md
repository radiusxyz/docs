# Lighthouse

**Lighthouse** is an open auction infrastructure where searchers bid for arbitrage bundle inclusion across Layer 1, Layer 2, and exchanges (CEX/DEX). Lighthouse creates new value-capture pathways that support advanced cross-market strategies, foster competitive price discovery, and unify markets under a common infrastructure.
