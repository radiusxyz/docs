# Lighthouse

**Lighthouse** is an open auction infrastructure where searchers bid for arbitrage bundle inclusion across Layer 1, Layer 2, and exchanges (CEX/DEX). Lighthouse creates new value-capture pathways that support advanced cross-market strategies, foster competitive price discovery, and unify markets under a common infrastructure.

> #### **Transaction Handling for SBB and Lighthouse**
>
> **Standalone SBB**: Coordinates both user transaction ordering and searcher bundles, optimized for local value capture.
>
> **SBB + Lighthouse**: SBB manages user transactions, while Lighthouse coordinates cross-market auctions. This expands arbitrage opportunities and supports more advanced trading strategies across interconnected venues.
