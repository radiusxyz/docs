# Secure Block Building (SBB) Overview

**Secure Block Building (SBB)** is protocol designed to provide institutional readiness for L1 and L2 blockchain networks. It solves the primary challenge of building blockchains by eliminating intermediary risk, guaranteeing operational resilience, and supporting efficient, sufficient markets.&#x20;

SBB is not an execution layer; it is a structural compliance layer guaranteeing neutral, non-intermediary transaction ordering, allowing institutional builders to focus on scaling financial markets without compromising compliance.

#### Key Benefits

SBB delivers uncompromising integrity across three critical dimensions for modern institutional infrastructure:

* **Regulatory Readiness**: Ensures the network meets the structural requirements for non-intermediary status by eliminating the source of intermediary risk (i.e., no single actor can unilaterally influence transaction order).
* **Operational Resilience**: Preserves system integrity under duress, guaranteeing continuous, fault-tolerant operations essential for high-value financial execution that can withstand attacks and system failures.
* Economic Efficiency: Facilitates robust economic growth by fostering efficient markets that support scalable, long-term revenue models (via anti-extractive mechanisms and arbitrage).

#### **Ready to evaluate SBB?**&#x20;

SBB is the final layer of infrastructure required to ensure your network is built for institutional readiness.&#x20;
