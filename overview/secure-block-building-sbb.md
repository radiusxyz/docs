# Secure Block Building (SBB)

### Introducing Secure Block Building

Secure Block Building (SBB) enables rollups to capture MEV as a new revenue source.

SBB enhances Layer 2 block building by providing a fast, secure, and fair method for rollups to access previously untapped MEV. This increases rollup profitability while supporting the growth of the ecosystem. SBB is the foundation for [Lighthouse](lighthouse.md), a broader vision that maximizes revenue potential by extending MEV capture across multiple domains - including rollups, Layer 1, and centralized exchanges.

### **Why Use SBB?**

SBB provides three key benefits:

* **More Revenue**: Works with searchers to capture MEV, creating a flexible revenue stream that scales with rollup adoption and adapts to market conditionsâ€”beyond just transaction fees.
* **User Safety**: Stops harmful MEV practices like frontrunning and sandwich attacks through one-second encryption and proof generation. This keeps user transactions secure while enabling rollups to profit from MEV.
* **Easy Integration**: Fits into existing rollup frameworks without added complexity, providing a straightforward path to increased revenue.

### How It Works

SBB integrates into rollups as a plug-in for MEV capture, with two main features:

* **Arbitrage Support**: Searchers spot arbitrage opportunities and submit bundles to SBB blockspace. This also includes CEX-DEX trades and liquidations, which generate additional revenue for the rollup.
* **Encrypted Mempool**: User transactions are encrypted and sent to SBB user blockspace, This protects them from manipulation while ensuring inclusion through preconfirmations.

### **SBB + Lighthouse: Cross-Rollup MEV**

SBB provides the foundation for MEV capture, while Lighthouse expands upon this by connecting rollups across Ethereum. This connection enables MEV opportunities between different rollups, increasing revenue potential for both rollups and searchers while fostering a more unified Ethereum ecosystem.
