# Secure Block Building (SBB)

**Secure Block Building (SBB)** is a highly-efficient transaction ordering protocol that optimizes block production for stronger economic outcomes. SBB helps rollups capture more revenue through orderly execution of searcher bundles, while preventing arbitrary reordering and predatory tactics like frontrunning. This design increases market efficiency, strengthens reliability in ordering, and ensures true economic alignment across participants.
