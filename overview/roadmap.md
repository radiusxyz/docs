# Roadmap

### Our Journey

With Secure Block Building (SBB) and Lighthouse, we're shaping a rollup economy that delivers user-safe MEV revenue, connects rollups, and maximizes value across Ethereum's ecosystem.

This roadmap outlines our path: we begin with SBB for individual rollups, scale to cross-rollup MEV with Lighthouse in 2025, and bridge L1-L2 opportunities by 2026—all to achieve economic unity across Ethereum.

### **(2025) SBB: Arbitrage Support for Rollups**

SBB enables searchers to submit MEV bundles directly to rollups, providing secure MEV capture for users.

* **Q1 2025:** SBB × Rollup Integration — User Protection
* **Q2 2025:** SBB x Rollup Integration — Rewards, Slashing, and MEV Revenue

### **(2025) Lighthouse: Cross-Rollup Expansion**

Lighthouse's decentralized network bridges multiple rollups with searchers, enabling safe MEV capture through competitive cross-rollup bidding.

* **Q2 2025:** Lighthouse 1.0 Testnet
* **Q4 2025:** Lighthouse 1.0 Mainnet

### **(2026) Lighthouse: L1-L2 Expansion**

Lighthouse extends MEV capture between Layer 1 and Layer 2, enabling cross-layer arbitrage and maximizing value throughout the Ethereum ecosystem.

* **Q2 2026:** Lighthouse 2.0 Testnet
* **Q4 2026:** Lighthouse 2.0 Mainnet
