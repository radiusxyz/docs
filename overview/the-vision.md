# The Vision

Ethereum was founded on the vision of providing a neutral, open infrastructure. As the ecosystem has scaled via rollups, however, new and opaque market structures have emerged. Value flows are split, transaction orderflow is obscured, and markets are siloed. This results in systemic inefficiency, misaligned incentives, and limited collaboration.

At the same time, the stakes are rising rapidly. Traditional finance and large-scale institutional capital are beginning to migrate onchain, demanding realiability, predictability, and transparency in operations. This migration necessitates compliant, auditable infrastructure to meet emerging global regulatory standards and mitigate systemic risk.

Radius is the solution built for this moment: We are building the critical infrastructure that restores transparent, open markets and enables trusted institutional adoption. Radius prepares Ethereum for the next era of global finance.
