# ONLY THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES SHOULD BE CHANGED

# ============================
# 🔒 Secure RPC Configuration
# ============================

# 🎯 Used to configure the RPC endpoint that can be identified and accessed 
# by users and transaction orderers.
SECURE_RPC_EXTERNAL_RPC_URL="http://127.0.0.1:6666"  # 🌐 External IP - Please update this.

# ============================
# 🔵 Rollup Configuration
# ============================

# 🏗️ Due to the ordering of transactions across multiple rollups, 
# the Rollup ID is required to identify the target rollup executor.
ROLLUP_ID="nodeinfra_rollup"  # ⚠️ Please update this Rollup ID.

# 💡 Since wallets support adding only a single network RPC URL, Secure-RPC must provide 
# all the methods that would be accessible without it when directly communicating 
# with the blockchain. Therefore, ROLLUP_RPC_URL is used to retrieve rollup information 
# and forward it to the wallet or client.
ROLLUP_RPC_URL="http://131.153.159.15:8123"  # 🌐 Please update this Rollup RPC URL.

# ============================
# 🔄 Sequencer Configuration
# ============================

# 🎯 Used to identify the target IP of the transaction orderer (tx. orderer) 
# responsible for receiving encrypted transactions and responding with order commitments.
SEQUENCER_RPC_RPC_URL="http://127.0.0.1:7777"  # 🌐 Please update this Sequencer (external) RPC URL.

# ============================
# 🔐 Encrypted Transaction Type
# ============================

# 🔏 Specifies the cryptographic scheme used for encrypting the user's transactions.
# Options: skde / pvde
ENCRYPTED_TRANSACTION_TYPE="skde"

# ============================
# 🔑 DKG (Distributed Key Generator)
# ============================

# 🔓 Used for retrieving SKDE parameters, encryption keys, and decryption keys from the DKG.
DISTRIBUTED_KEY_GENERATOR_RPC_URL="http://127.0.0.1:7100"  # 🌐 Please update this Distributed Key Generator (external) RPC URL.
