# Run Tx. Orderer

## **Prerequisites**

### **1. Installations**

1. `Rust`, `Foundry`, `build-essential`, `pkg-config`, `libssl-dev`, `libclang-dev` must be installed.
2.  Run the following shell command to match the correct version:

    `foundryup -v nightly-5b7e4cb3c882b28f3c32ba580de27ce7381f415a`

### 2. Contract calls

All smart contract function calls must be executed with success.

_Note:_ We use two separate accounts for different purposes:

* The **operator account** (secured by `OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY`) is **only** used for registering the operator in Symbiotic.
* The **operating account** (secured by `OPERATING_PRIVATE_KEY`) is responsible for running our tx. orderer.

This setup follows best practices recommended by other operators. They avoid using their operator private key for running programs to minimize security risks. To enhance security, our system ensures that the operator private key is strictly for registration, while the operating private key manages tx. orderer operations within the network.

### **3. Running Tx. Orderer**

Repository: [Sequencer GitHub](https://github.com/radiusxyz/sequencer.git)

_**Note**:_ A cluster is a group of tx. orderers with a leader. This process can run with a single tx. orderer as well. Do not be confused by the `.env` variables referencing clusters.

### Key Details

* **Language and Build Requirements:** The Tx. Orderer is written in Rust and must be built using `cargo build --release` in the root directory.
* **Environment Variables:**
  * Create an `env.sh` file at `sequencer/scripts/execute/env.sh` based on the contents of `env_example.sh`.
  * Ensure the ports defined in `env.sh` are available.
  * Another `env.sh` is needed at `sequencer/scripts/rpc-call/env.sh` for RPC-related scripts, also derived from `env_example.sh`.
* **Initialization Scripts:**
  * Tx. orderer is initialized and run using scripts located in the repository:
    * `sequencer/scripts/execute/01_init_sequencer.sh`
    * `sequencer/scripts/execute/02_run_sequencer.sh`

_Note_: the tx. orderer is configured to support various types of liveness and validation. Additionally, a single tx. orderer is not limited to operating for just one rollup but is designed to manage multiple rollups. If the components currently provided through APIs were converted into configurations, the tx. orderer serving an existing rollup would need to be restarted each time a new rollup is added. To prevent this, these components are structured as APIs.

***

#### Hardware Specs

* CPU: 4
* Memory (GiB): 16
* Network (Gbps): 1
* Storage (GB): 256

#### Running the Tx. Orderer

1.  Clone the repository&#x20;

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/radiusxyz/sequencer
    ```
2.  Build the binary

    ```sh
    cd sequencer
    cargo build --release
    ```
3. Set up environment variables in `./scripts/execute/env.sh`.
4.  Initialize the Tx. Orderer:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/execute/01_init_sequencer.sh
    ```
5.  Start the Tx. Orderer:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/execute/02_run_sequencer.sh
    ```
6. Set up environment variables in `sequencer/scripts/rpc-call/env.sh`.
7.  **Initialize RPC for adding the sequencing info related to LivenessServiceManager contract:** This action serves for integrating liveness information from the LivenessServiceManager smart contract into the tx. orderer. Upon completion, the tx. orderer will be able to listen to events related to the LivenessServiceManager smart contract on the `LIVENESS_PLATFORM`, retrieve information about tx. orderers and rollups, and invoke functions within the smart contract:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/rpc-call/11_add_sequencing_info.sh
    ```
8.  **Add validation service details with RPC:** This action serves for integrating validation information from the ValidationServiceManager smart contract into the tx. orderer. Upon completion, the tx. orderer will be able to listen to events related to the ValidationServiceManager smart contract on the VALIDATION\_PLATFORM, retrieve information from the ValidationServiceManager contract, and invoke its functions.

    ```bash
    ./scripts/rpc-call/12_add_symbiotic_validation_info.sh
    ```
9.  **Add cluster info:** This action serves for integrating cluster information, registered in the smart contract, into the tx. orderer. Upon completion, the tx. orderer will collect events whenever a block is generated in LIVENESS\_PLATFORM and automatically update itself with the relevant cluster information.&#x20;

    ```bash
    ./scripts/rpc-call/13_add_cluster.sh
    ```
