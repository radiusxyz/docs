# Liveness

A key advantage of distributed systems is their fault tolerance. In the current architecture, since the main actions depend on the leader, a robust recovery mechanism is essential. This mechanism should ensure the system's liveness by:

1. **Quick Transition to a New Leader:** Ensuring that a new leader can be quickly established if the current leader fails.
2. **Data Synchronization:** Keeping data synchronized across all nodes to maintain continuous operation even during a leader transition.

These measures ensure the system remains operational and efficient, even in the event of a leader failure.
