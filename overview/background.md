# Background

Ethereum was founded on the vision of providing a neutral, open infrastructure. But as Ethereum has scaled through rollups, new market structures have emerged. We now see fragmentation: value flows split across rollups, opaque transaction orderflow, and siloed markets. The result is inefficiency, misaligned incentives, and limited collaboration between participants.

At the same time, the stakes are rising. Institutional assets and large-scale capital are beginning to migrate onchain, demanding reliable, predictable, and transparent operations.&#x20;

**Radius exists to meet this moment: building infrastructure that restores openness, fosters collaboration, and prepares Ethereum for the next era of global markets.**
