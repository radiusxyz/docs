# Introduction

### What is Radius?

Radius builds **open market infrastructure** that unifies fragmented venues and unlocks ecosystem-wide opportunities for Ethereum. By breaking down silos across rollups, exchanges (CEX/DEX), and isolated markets, Radius enables participants to access new pathways for collaboration and efficient value capture.

### Background <a href="#why-radius" id="why-radius"></a>

Ethereum was founded on the vision of providing a neutral, open infrastructure. But as Ethereum has scaled through rollups, new market structures have emerged. We now see fragmentation: value flows split across rollups, opaque transaction orderflow, and siloed markets. The result is inefficiency, misaligned incentives, and limited collaboration between participants.

At the same time, the stakes are rising. Institutional assets and large-scale capital are beginning to migrate onchain who demand reliable, predictable, and transparent operations. To meet these expectations, Ethereum must evolve, or it risks recreating the same closed and concentrated systems it set out to replace.

Radius exists to meet this moment: building infrastructure that restores openness, aligns incentives, and prepares Ethereum ready for the next era of global markets.

### Why Radius <a href="#why-radius" id="why-radius"></a>

* **Universal Transparency:** All value flows from revenue generation to distribution, are visible.
* **Unified Markets:** Fragmented L1/L2/CEX/DEX activity is coordinated into a single system.
* **Aligned Incentives:** Growth for one participant multiplies growth across the ecosystem.
* **Future-Ready:** Compliance-ready frameworks prepare rollups and protocols for institutional adoption and regulatory clarity.

### Product

**Secure Block Building (SBB)**: A high-efficiency transaction ordering framework that optimizes block production for stronger economic outcomes. SBB helps rollups capture new revenue sources through orderly execution while mitigating risks like arbitrary reordering and exploitative tactics. This improves market efficiency, strengthens operational transparency, and aligns incentives across participants.

**Lighthouse:** An open auction infrastructure where searchers bid for arbitrage bundle inclusion across Layer 1, Layer 2, and exchanges (CEX/DEX). Lighthouse creates new value-capture pathways that support advanced cross-market strategies, foster competitive price discovery, and unify markets under a common infrastructure.
