# About Radius

### Introduction <a href="#why-radius" id="why-radius"></a>

Ethereum powers DeFi and global onchain markets, yet much of its value today flows through **opaque mechanisms** and remains trapped in **fragmented silos**. This reduces trust, limits network effects, and slows ecosystem-wide growth.

Radius builds the **economic trust layer for Ethereum**: infrastructure that makes **value flows transparent, markets unified, and incentives aligned**, enabling rollups, searchers, and L1/L2 infrastructure to build on markets that scale collectively, not in isolation.\

### Why Radius <a href="#why-radius" id="why-radius"></a>

* **Universal Transparency:** All value flows from revenue generation to distribution, are visible.
* **Unified Markets:** Fragmented L1/L2/CEX/DEX activity is coordinated into a single system.
* **Aligned Incentives:** Growth for one participant multiplies growth across the ecosystem.
* **Future-Ready:** Transparent frameworks prepare rollups and protocols for institutional adoption and regulatory clarity.

### Products

Radius offers two products designed to bring transparency and unified Ethereum markets:

**Secure Block Building (SBB)**: Transparent, open markets

* Provides rollups with top-of-block backrunning slots for arbitrage strategies across CEX and DEX markets.
* Uses open auctions where searchers compete, creating new revenue for rollups.
