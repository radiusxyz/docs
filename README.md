# What is Radius?

Radius builds **open market infrastructure** to support truly open and scalable economic activity on Ethereum.&#x20;

Our infrastructure connects rollups and searchers into a single collaborative network - enabling new ways to access opportunities and capture value. With protocols like [Secure Block Building (SBB)](overview/secure-block-building-sbb.md) and [Lighthouse](overview/lighthouse/), the ecosystem can run competitive auctions, execute advanced arbitrage, and unlock revenue in ways that benefit the whole ecosystem.&#x20;

By breaking down silos across rollups, exchanges (CEX/DEX), and isolated markets, Radius makes markets more open, incentive-aligned, and efficient in how value is shared across Ethereum.

***

Radius brings three core advantages to Ethereum:

* **Transparency at every layer** – Clear visibility to how value flows, from transaction ordering to final market outcomes.
* **Collaborative markets** – Open coordination across participants, where opportunities are broadly accessible.
* **Institutional readiness** – Predictable, compliance-friendly systems that position Ethereum as a credible foundation for global-scale markets.
