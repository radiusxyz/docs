# Introduction

Rollups are critical for Ethereum’s scalability but rely on volatile transaction fees, creating economic uncertainty. Radius addresses this by leveraging MEV to stabilize revenue and support Layer 2 (L2) growth.

### What We Do

Secure Block Building (SBB) and Lighthouse enable L2s to generate revenue from MEV while preventing user-harming practices, such as frontrunning. They optimize MEV strategies to deliver consistent income for L2s, supporting scalable and fair networks. For details on backrunning and MEV, see [Understanding MEV](overview/understanding-mev.md).



**Secure Block Building (SBB)**

SBB integrates with L2s to generate MEV revenue through backrunning collaborating with searchers, without impacting user transactions.

**Lighthouse**

Lighthouse is a decentralized network that connects L2s and searchers to generate MEV revenue through backrunning strategies across the Ethereum ecosystem, including L2s, L1, and centralized exchanges, for enhnaced revenue.&#x20;
