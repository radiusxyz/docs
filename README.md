# Introduction

### What is Radius?

Radius builds **open market infrastructure** that ensures Ethereum can scale with openness, trust, and collaboration as its foundation. It unifies fragmented venues and unlocks ecosystem-wide opportunities for Ethereum. By breaking down silos across rollups, exchanges (CEX/DEX), and isolated markets, Radius enables participants to access new pathways for collaboration and efficient value capture.

Radius brings three core advantages to Ethereum’s market infrastructure:

* **Transparency at every layer** – bringing visibility to how value flows, from transaction ordering to market outcomes.
* **Collaborative markets** – coordinating participants within open markets where opportunities are broadly accessible.&#x20;
* **Institutional readiness** – creating predictable, compliance-friendly systems that make Ethereum a credible foundation for global-scale markets.

### Background <a href="#why-radius" id="why-radius"></a>

Ethereum was founded on the vision of providing a neutral, open infrastructure. But as Ethereum has scaled through rollups, new market structures have emerged. We now see fragmentation: value flows split across rollups, opaque transaction orderflow, and siloed markets. The result is inefficiency, misaligned incentives, and limited collaboration between participants.

At the same time, the stakes are rising. Institutional assets and large-scale capital are beginning to migrate onchain, demanding reliable, predictable, and transparent operations. Radius exists to meet this moment: building infrastructure that restores openness, fosters collaboration, and prepares Ethereum for the next era of global markets.
