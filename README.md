# What is Radius?

Radius builds **open market infrastructure** that ensures Ethereum can scale with openness, trust, and collaboration as its foundation. It unifies fragmented venues and unlocks ecosystem-wide opportunities for Ethereum. By breaking down silos across rollups, exchanges (CEX/DEX), and isolated markets, Radius enables participants to access new pathways for collaboration and efficient value capture.

***

Radius brings three core advantages to Ethereum’s market infrastructure:

* **Transparency at every layer** – bringing visibility to how value flows, from transaction ordering to market outcomes.
* **Collaborative markets** – coordinating participants within open markets where opportunities are broadly accessible.&#x20;
* **Institutional readiness** – creating predictable, compliance-friendly systems that make Ethereum a credible foundation for global-scale markets.
